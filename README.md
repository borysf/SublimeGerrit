# SublimeGerrit
The full-featured Gerrit Code Review integration for **Sublime Text 3 (will not work in Sublime Text 2)**


## Installation
### via Git clone
Clone this repo into Sublime Text's Packages directory. Target directory name **must** be SublimeGerrit.


## Setup
1. Open Command Palette
2. Search for "Gerrit: Basic Setup"
3. Select "General > Connection"
4. Type your connection details. Host name must be in form: http(s)://host:port[/path]
5. Back to Basic Setup and select "General > Git"
6. Configure your Git settings


## Advanced setup
More advanced settings can be changed via "Preferences > Package Settings > SublimeGerrit - User". Please also take a look at "Preferences > Package Settings > SublimeGerrit - Default" for all accessible settings.


## Note
Previously the project was a closed-source and required license purchase for continued use. Because it was not very popular, I decided to publish it freely. Anyway, I'd like to thank these few great people who decided to support me by purchasing a license! :)
