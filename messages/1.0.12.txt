SublimeGerrit has just been upgraded!

It is highly recommended to restart Sublime Text before first use.
------------------------------------------------------------------

What's new?
===========

The plugin is now open-source and no longer require license for continued use. I decided to
make it free and open because of insignificant user's interest.

Anyway, I'd like to thank these few users who decided to support me and purchased a license!
You're great! :)
